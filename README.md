# FeatureCreep

Welcome to FeatureCreep, a project where all features are welcome!

## Currently Implemented Features

-   Pomodoro
-   Dune Tracker

## Pomodoro

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method for students, perfectionists, and procrastinators of all kinds. It involves working in focused, 25-minute intervals.

There are three timer modes based on the Pomodoro technique: work, break, and long break.

Users can customize the pomodoro format to suit their specific needs. For example, a format like (50/10/30) might be preferable for certain work activities compared to the standard (25/5/15).

Tasks can be created to stay organized and focused during work time. Completed tasks can be checked off the list.

## Dune

Dune: Imperium is a game that draws inspiration from elements and characters in the Dune legacy, including the new film from Legendary Pictures and the original literary series by Frank Herbert, Brian Herbert, and Kevin J. Anderson.

For competitive gameplay of this board game, tracking statistics for specific leaders can be beneficial. The leaders are displayed in a grid with their overall stats for each player. Clicking on a leader provides a detailed breakdown of their stats. Additionally, the page includes a match history of games played with that leader in that expansion. New games can also be added from this page.
