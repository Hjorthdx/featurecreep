## Pomodoro
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method for students, perfectionists, and procrastinators of all kinds. Work in focused, 25-minute intervals.

Three different timer modes according to the Pomodoro technique (work, break & long break).

Different pomodoro format can be customized to the specific users needs. For instance perhabs a format of (50/10/30) is preferable compared to (25/5/15) for some work activities.

Tasks can be created to keep organized of what to focus on during work time. These can be checked off once they are completed.

## Dune
Dune: Imperium is a game that finds inspiration in elements and characters from the Dune legacy, both the new film from Legendary Pictures and the seminal literary series from Frank Herbert, Brian Herbert, and Kevin J. Anderson.

Competetive playing of this board game can benefit from keeping track of stats for the specific leaders in the game. The leaders of the game are placed in a grid with overall stats of each leader for a player shown. Each leader can be clicked for a more detailed stat breakdown for that specific leader. This page also contains a match history of all the games the user have played on that leader in that expansion. Adding games can also be added from here.
